# tv-script-generator
Third project from Deep Learning Nanodegree Program at [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-learning-nanodegree--nd101)

In this project, you'll generate your own Seinfeld TV scripts using RNNs. You'll be using part of the Seinfeld dataset of scripts from 9 seasons. The Neural Network you'll build will generate a new ,"fake" TV script, based on patterns it recognizes in this training data.
